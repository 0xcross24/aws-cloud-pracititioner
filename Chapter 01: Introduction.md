# What is Cloud Computing
There's no significant difference between running a software application on servers hosted in your own office versus locating it within Amazon's infrastructure

## Highly Available and Scalable Resources
- Design multiple layers of redundancy so that whenever one component fails, its workload is automatically and instantly moved to a healthy replacement
- Connect resources in geographically remote locations so that the failure of one complete region could trigger a predefined relocation. This relocation can be supported by a similarly automated rerouting of network requests
- Provide customers with access to as much compute power as they could possibly need, and delivery that power on-demand
- Because of the scale and efficiency of the platform, AWS can do all that at a price that's often far below what it would cost to run comparable workloads locally
