# What is Cloud Computing
There's no significant difference between running a software application on servers hosted in your own office versus locating it within Amazon's infrastructure

## Highly Available and Scalable Resources
- Design multiple layers of redundancy so that whenever one component fails, its workload is automatically and instantly moved to a healthy replacement
- Connect resources in geographically remote locations so that the failure of one complete region could trigger a predefined relocation. This relocation can be supported by a similarly automated rerouting of network requests
- Provide customers with access to as much compute power as they could possibly need, and delivery that power on-demand
- Because of the scale and efficiency of the platform, AWS can do all that at a price that's often far below what it would cost to run comparable workloads locally

## Professionally Secured Infrastructure
As a business, you are responsible for protecting the workstations and networking hardware running in your office along with securing your organization's data and code your developers put into your apps. The integrity of your underlying server infrastructure is just one more potential area of vulnerability for you to worry about.

AWS provides and takes responsibility for the security of its platform's underlying networking and compute infrastructure.
