# The Basic Support Plan

You get limited access to the Trusted Advisor tool. And receive alerts concerning interruptions to any AWS services through Personal Health Dashboard (PHD)

## The Developer Support Plan

Not recommended for critical applications. The direct access to AWS cloud support associates is limited to emails during business hours.

## The Business Support Plan

The TAM becomes closely involved in your deployment, guiding your team through planning, launches, and proactive reviews.
